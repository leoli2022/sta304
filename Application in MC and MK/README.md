#Applications in Monte Carlo Sampling and Markov Chains (Inbreeding Coefficient estimator)

The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium is critical in human genetics approaches. It states that allele and genotype frequencies remain constant throughout generations and that there should be a straightforward relationship between these two kinds of frequencies in a large random-mating population in the absence of selection, mutation, and migration. When the selection assumption is broken, the inbreeding model is utilised to determine if the HW equilibrium has been disturbed. Numerous approaches for calculating the inbreeding coefficient have been proposed, but none have proven state-of-the-art performance owing to the challenges associated with solving complicated integrals. As a result, we offer an upgrade to the present techniques for estimating inbreeding coefficients in this study by incorporating the Markov Chain Monte Carlo as an integration approximator. The experiment results indicate that for both high-dimensional and low-dimensional data, the Metropolis-Hastings-within-Gibbs strategy outperformed all other MCMC approaches.
